# Cow Game

A simple PyGame app where you can create and interact with cows.

## Installation

To install the app, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher and pipenv installed on your system. You can install pipenv by running:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Then, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/cow-game.git
cd cow-game
```

Next, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies from the Pipfile:

```bash
pipenv install
```

## Usage

To run the app, activate the virtual environment and execute the main.py file:

```bash
pipenv shell
python main.py
```

You should see a window with a grassy background and some buttons. You can click on the buttons to create cows of different colors. You can also click on the cows to see their names and agility stats in a small window. The agility stat determines how fast they move around.

To quit the app, press ESC or close the window.
